# JAMSPantry
Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Pantry interfaced with Firebase Cloud Firestore REST API for client authentication.

#### The intent of this project is to design and implement a system that scans the barcode of a food product that will be placed into one's pantry and store the contents information to a database. A Rapsberry Pi 4, Arduino Nano BLE 33, Weight Sensors (used for acquiring the relative mass of an object), Raspberry Pi Camera, and Pi Attachment Output Display will be deployed and interfaced with Firebase (a non-relational database or NoSQL database) which will house all the user's information in relation to the food items in their cubbard. Our Smart Pantry will be able to gather data and be able to display product information to an output display screen. Any information will be available to the user from virtual anywhere using our web application and iOS/Andriod app. 

#### Security features will be added to ensure user privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, Firebase Cloud Firestore REST API will be implemented to provide an additonal layer of security and authetication when a client makes a request. Verification will be introduced to prevent against unauthorized third-party access. 

#### Purpose: There is a need in the market for a product that will allow one to virtually be able to access their pantry from any location. How many times have you gone to the grocery stor and forgot your shopping list at home? With JAMSPantry you will be able to know exactly what products you have, the amount of items, and even the weight of an item. With the features provided in our application, you can even query information and data about the products such as expiration dates so you know exactly when a product may expire. 

#### The ML Kit for barcode scanning will be used so machine learning will be applied to our project.
