# JAMSPantry
Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Pantry interfaced with Firebase Cloud Firestore REST API for client authentication.

#### The intent of this project is to design and implement a system that scans the image of an item or food product that will be placed into one's pantry. A Rapsberry Pi 4, Arduino Nano BLE 33, Weight Sensors (used for acquiring the relative mass of an object), Raspberry Pi Camera, and Pi Attachment Output Display will be deployed and interfaced with Firebase (a non-relational database or NoSQL database) which will house all the user's information in relation to the food items in their cubbard. Our Smart Pantry will be able to gather data and be able to display product information to an output display screen. Any information will be available to the user from virtual anywhere using our web application and iOS/Andriod app. 

Security features will be added to ensure user privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, Firebase Cloud Firestore REST API will be implemented to provide an additonal layer of security and authetication when a client makes a request. Verification will be introduced to prevent against unauthorized access.
